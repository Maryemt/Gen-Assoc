## Introduction
* Many studies in Africa with recruitment in families (trio, nuclear families data)
* Study of Infectious disease (multifactorial diseases, complex traits)
* Need statistical analysis methods and tools to handle data from such studies

##  About 
	
	The program is for family-based genome-wide screening of single and joint effects of genetic mutations on infectious disease traits, either qualitative or quantitative traits, regardless of phenotype distribution.

#### Strengths
Ability to find joint effects of several markers impacting phenotypes in a context of small sample size
Retrieve markers that would be missed by classical approaches
Handles of main statistical issues like:
	non-specified distribution of traits
	related individuals
	population admixture
	linkage disequilibrium among markers


##  Installation 

> Two versions of the tool are available: the CLI and the Webservice.
 
 
 Installation  guide for Webservice Version
 
 We  have two kind of installation  process in easy step  
 by **cloning the repos** or **using  Docker container** 
 

 ### Cloning
 #### Requirements
 Before  Starting  installation Part we should  tell you   the requirements to run  the Application 
 correctly.
 For the internal usage you need  to  install  [plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink)  Binaries 
 ![plink binary](images/plinkbinloc.png) 
 
 *Choose your System  arichecture  type !!!* 
  
 ```diff 
 - doesn'work correctly  on busybox  
 ```
 
 And assure  that  you  have  **_git_**  and **_Nodejs_** available  in  your system  
 end  some point [_Docker_]   but it's  optional  except  if   you want build a custum image  
 with  the  existant Docker file  
  

 --- 
 First  copy the  link  and go to your terminal 
 
 <img src="images/cloning.png" width="500" alt="start"/>

 ```bash 
 $  git clone https://github.com/avalanche-org/Gen_Assoc.git
 ``` 
 
 After then go to apps folder   and  install the requiered dependencies  
 
 ```bash  
 $ cd  Gen_Assoc  ; cd apps 
 $ npm install
 ``` 


Once   it done  you can finaly run the application  

```bash
$ npm run build 
```
 _*hint_ :
 > Check  the  package.json file  for more  command to  run
 


If you have some experience with  Docker it's may be insterresting to make your onw build.  
Some  arguments inputs are allowed to custom your docker image during the  build 

In  Dockerfile  the  Lines which  have   *ARGS ARGUMENT=value*  statement  can be modified during the build 
```diff 
+ $  docker build .   --build-arg  ARGUMENT=<_new_value_>  -t <your_tag_name>
```


#### Docker 

For  this  section  Docker  only is required .  

The  Webservice  is Avalaible  on docker Registry  

``` 
$ docker search  m-tdt   
```

 <hr>
 <img src="images/dockerRistryfound.png" width="600"  alt="GA-dockerhubRegistry">
 </figcaption>
 
 You  can pull   Directly   The  Webservice app  directly  from the docker  Registry 

```diff
+ $  docker pull  jukoo/m-tdt
```
 
To  launch  The  docker application 


```bash
$  docker  run  -d  -p <localport>:<containerPort> jukoo/m-tdt  
```

_The default port of  the container is **4000**_  using  environment variable  

<u>_example_</u>: 
>  **docker run  -d  -p 3000:4000  jukoo/m-tdt**

<u>if  you  want to modify the default </u>
>
> **docker  run  -d  -e PORT=5000   -p 3000:5000   jukoo/m-tdt**


Here you are  now  let's see  to get your work done :rocket: 



##### COMPLETE OR INCOMPLETE BUILD PROCESS #CIBP  


The docker image provided is a complete image that contains the whole application 
of the application available at the following address  [docker hub]("https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jukoo/m-tdt"). 


Here are the step to get full build of image  

1 -> build the docker image using the current Dockerfile 

```
$> docker build .  -t <yourImageTagName> 
```

From here we have a basic image of the application  
but you have to take into account that every time you start the application it will do an installation 
dependencies for a first operation   

To go to the complete phase of the image   

you have to proceed as follows: 

once the first step is over, we enter the container  
 
```
$> docker run -d --name <container_name> -p<hostPort>:<containerPort> <yourImageTagName>  
$> docker exec -ti <container_name> bash    
#> cd /mTDT 
```

You will find a file RpkgAutorun.py (it allows to deduct the missing libraries) 
to install them  

```
#> ./RpkgAutorun.py --install or -i  
```
(It will take some time) 
  

Once it's finished, we leave the container  

```
#>exit  
```

And we go to the last step.

We create a snapshot of the image 
```
$> docker commit -m <message> -a <outside> <container_name> <yourImageTagName>:<version> 
```

this version **<yourImageTagName>:<version>** will be the complete version of the application, which includes 
dependencies.  

complete and incomplete: 

Incomplete Image: 

-> because you have to build the dependencies  
-> also count the time to build the dependencies 


Complete Image : 
everything is already upstream  

If you want to do some manipulation more it would be better to use the incomplete image  
otherwise if you just want to use the application on the complete image 


**BASIC DOCKER IMAGE -> MTDT IMCOMPLETE IMAGE (APPLICATION)  ->  MTDT COMPLETE IMAGE (APPLICATION + BINARIES)**
