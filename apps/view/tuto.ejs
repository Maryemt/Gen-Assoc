The button opens a window with a view of your local files. You can select the files whose formats must meet the following specifications:
INPUT FILE FORMAT

    * No headers in any of the 3 input files.
    * The columns of all input files are separated by tabs.

    (i) PED file: starts with 6 columns followed by genotype columns, in the following order
        - Family ID
        - Individual ID
        - Father ID
        - mother's ID
        - sex
        - condition (this column will not be taken into account, but its presence is required)

        - genotype columns (...)

    ! !! TIP: The 'ped' file can contain multiple markers, but we advise at the runtime stage to include a limited number of markers, e.g. 3 to 5,
